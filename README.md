Flashcard is a language focused learning app I made because I couldn't find a free one to do what I want.

The aim is simple - mixed quizzes with Lithuanian/English words and pick the right one.

Backend is Laravel, frontend is Vue. Just a personal project for now, but I might put up a live version one day.

To setup, run (in order) CountrySeeder, LanguageSeeder, QuizLevelSeeder, FlashcardSeeder. This will load in the data from ./private/storage/*.csv to bootstrap the initial Lithuanian quiz
